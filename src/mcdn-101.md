## Use a Custom domain

1.  Click**Add domain**

When you create a new site on MCDN, itâ€™s instantly secured at the Default Domain URL (for example,Â `https://rhwrlulrle.m-cdn.io`). If you add aÂ **Custom domain**, we will automatically provision a certificate withÂ [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), enabling HTTPS on your domain. Certificates are generated and renewed automatically as needed.

4. Installing SSL Certificates

MCDN offers two different ways of providing a certificate for HTTPS.

- [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) **certificates**Â are offered to all mcdn sites for free.
- **Custom certificates**Â are a way for you to provide a certificate that matches your specifications â€” things like a wildcard certificate or an Extended Validation (EV) certificate.
