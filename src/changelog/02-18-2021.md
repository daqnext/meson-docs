# Testnet 2.5


Decouple the structure between storage and retrieval, develop the architecture to support all kinds of origin URL based on HTTP302.

Support the m3u8 standard to power the video and livestreaming platform (e.g. <a href="http://hotcat.live">hotcat.live</a>).

Deploy the testnet token mapping contract and add Meson Improvement Proposals(<a href="https://github.com/daqnext/MIP">MIPs</a>).Users can join the governance for the network.

Target early adopters.
