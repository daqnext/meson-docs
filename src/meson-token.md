MSN is Meson.Network's incentive and governance token. It has four primary functions:

- For rewarding miners
- For staking by miners
- As payment by users
- Protocol governance
- The tokens are distributed to network terminals (miners) as rewards for providing server resources.

Currently, there are no benefits for staking the tokens as the functions of transfer for Meson Test Tokens on Ethereum are locked. Users of the services will pay in MSN to get additional bandwidth. These tokens are then rewarded to miners through the repurchase and destruction of tokens.

Meson allows its Token holders to vote on development or modification of parameters of the protocol.

- MSN tokens empower users to access bandwidth and big-data services previously exclusive to major corporations such as Google and Akamai. 1.1 The bandwidth service accelerates internet content delivery, encompassing webpages, videos, streaming content, files, and more. 1.2 The big-data service emerges as a pivotal success factor across diverse industries, including online advertising, social media, marketing, finance, and beyond.
- MSN tokens are granted as rewards to miners who contribute server resources to the Meson network.
- MSN tokens, when staked by miners, lead to increased efficiency in mining operations.
- MSN tokens are used by network participants for engaging in governance processes, such as voting in elections and making decisions on on-chain proposals.

## Token Circulation

Miners will get MSN as a reward while providing an idle server to meson.network. Miners will reach full mining speed only if they stack MSN accordingly. Clients send payments to meson.network while using Meson service. All MSN can be exchanged at CEX or DEX.
