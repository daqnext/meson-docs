# $MSN üê¢

MSN is Meson.Network's incentive and governance token. It has four primary functions:

- For rewarding miners
- For staking by miners
- As payment by users
- Protocol governance
- The tokens are distributed to network terminals (miners) as rewards for providing server resources.

Currently, there are no benefits for staking the tokens as the functions of transfer for Meson Test Tokens on Ethereum are locked. Users of the services will pay in MSNs to get additional bandwidth. These tokens are then rewarded to miners through the repurchase and destruction of tokens.

Meson allows its Token holders to vote on development or modification of parameters of the protocol.

## Token Circulation

Miners will get MSNs as a reward while providing an idle server to meson.network. Miners will reach full mining speed only if they stack MSNs accordingly. Clients send payments to meson.network while using Meson service. All MSNs can be exchanged at CEX or DEX.
