## MSN Credit

MSN Credits are the mechanism by which all Meson Network usage is paid for. In the future, these tokens will be utilized for the circulation of bandwidth, playing a crucial role in the development of the Meson Exchange.

**MSN Credit Fundamentals**

As an example, three MSN Credits are equivalent to one MSN based on the current exchange rate on the Goerli.

`MSN => MSN_Credit swap ratio: 1:3`

**Acquiring MSN Credits**

At the network level, MSN Credits are generated solely through the conversion of MSN, a process that can be accomplished through `Onchain Swap`.

::: tip 🚧 MSN CREDITS ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE
After the completion of the MSN Credit mint transaction, the receiving wallet address possesses all of the MSN Credits and is unable to transfer them to any other wallet address.
