# Roadmap

In 2022, we expect to launch the first mainnet version of Meson Network on Ethereum. Users can start trading bandwidth resources on Meson upon our launch. At the same time, we will design the token incentives and corresponding mechanisms for participants in the system. After the mainnet launch, we will support various EVM-compatible chains, lower the threshold for users to use the network, and begin to integrate decentralized home nodes as a complement to the network. In the third step, we will become the default provider of bandwidth resources for the Web 3 decentralized cloud.
